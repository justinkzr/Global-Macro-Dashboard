📅 Date: 18 Aug - 24 Aug 2025	

🌎 Macro Environment Summary: 

US

Policy & markets. The Aug jobs report (Fri, Sep 5) showed nonfarm payrolls +22k and unemployment 4.3%, reinforcing expectations of a September Fed cut; futures added a small tail risk of 50 bp. Front-end yields fell and risk rallied into the close. 


Growth pulse & prices. Activity data stayed mixed: ISM Manufacturing 48.7 (contraction, but improving) and ISM Services 52.0 (expansion); S&P Global flash composite held at 55.4 in August. The setup is “cooling labor, still-OK activity,” keeping the Fed easing-biased but data-dependent into CPI week. 

Takeaway. Markets are heavily priced for a Sep 16–17 cut; the near-term asymmetry is to the upside in yields/USD if inflation surprises hot. 


Eurozone

Inflation & policy. Flash HICP rose to 2.1% y/y (Aug) from 2.0% (Jul), consistent with the ECB pausing in September while keeping optionality later in the year. 


Activity. HCOB composite PMI ~51.0 in Aug (12-month high but modest momentum), with curves still taking direction from the US. 


China

Data. Official NBS manufacturing PMI 49.4 (fifth month of contraction); non-manufacturing 50.3. Caixin PMIs were firmer (mfg 50.5; services 53.0; composite 51.9), pointing to services-led stabilization.

Policy & FX. Policymakers continued to signal a preference for CNY stability, even as growth signals are mixed. 


Other

Japan. Q2 capex +7.6% y/y supports domestic demand; Tokyo core CPI 2.5% y/y (Aug) keeps BOJ normalization risk alive. BOJ Gov. Ueda reiterated the bank could keep raising if conditions warrant; revised Q2 GDP due Sep 8. 


EM flows. IIF estimated $55.5bn EM portfolio inflows in July (2nd-largest in four years), a supportive backdrop that carried into August barring US data shocks. 


📊 Market Drivers (1–8 Sep)

Rates. Post-NFP, the US curve bull-steepened: 2y ~3.47–3.53%, 10y ~4.08–4.10% by Friday; attention turns to CPI. Ongoing discussion of term-premium/fiscal risks keeps the long end sticky even as the front end prices cuts. 


FX. The USD fell after NFP (DXY ~97.5), EUR firmed toward 1.17, and USDJPY slipped toward 147–148 on softer US yields and lingering BOJ normalization risk. 


Commodities.
• Oil: Drifted lower on a surprise US crude build and expectations that OPEC+ could raise output again; Brent ~$66–68 late-week. 


• Gold: Popped to fresh records >$3,500/oz as cut odds rose and the USD softened. 


• Copper: The tariff-trade premium on COMEX continued to unwind after confirmation that semi-finished copper, not refined, is targeted—pressuring the earlier US premium. 


Equities.
• US: Major indices hit record intraday highs Friday as the weak jobs print boosted cut odds; tech led on AI-related beats. 


• Europe: Stocks up on tech M&A headlines and calmer rates; still sensitive to ECB communication and fiscal headlines. 


• Asia: Japan choppy (rates chatter); China supported by local risk appetite (margin financing elevated). 


📌 Positioning / Sentiment

• Fed (Sep): Markets largely price a 25 bp cut, with a non-trivial 50 bp tail after NFP. 


• Dollar: Momentum shorts re-engaged post-NFP; DXY at ~97.5 into the weekend. 


• Rates bias: Steepener remains consensus—front-end anchored by cuts while long-end reflects supply/term-premium and fiscal worries. 


• EM risk: Constructive after the IIF July surge, but dispersion remains (China-beta, local politics). 


🧠 Personal Takeaways

US: The Fed now has cover to cut in September, barring an upside CPI surprise. That favors front-end duration and steepeners as long-end term premium resists. 


Eurozone: “Pause-and-assess” fits HICP 2.1% and modest PMI gains; EUR trades largely on the Fed path near-term. 
European Commission


China: Mixed PMIs with policy leaning toward FX stability over bazooka-style easing → patience on China-beta. 


Japan: Capex strength + sticky CPI keep BOJ normalization risk live; watch Sep 8 GDP revision and wage follow-through for JPY/JGB term premia.
