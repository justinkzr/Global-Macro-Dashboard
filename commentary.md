üåé Macro Environment Summary: 

**US:**

**Monetary Policy & Inflation:** 

Fed held rates steady at 4.25-4.50%, resisting intense pressure from Trump to cut rates aggressively. Powell emphasized the focus on controlling inflation amid risks from the administration's trade policies, and gave little hint of easing by September. Inflation has begun to tick higher again with June CPI coming in at +2.7% yoy (Core +2.9%), as tariffs drove up prices of imported goods. Powell thinks that these tariff effects may not be transitory and thus there is no rush to cut rates until more data confirms a downturn. However, with recent NFP data that showed payrolls increased 73,000 in July vs a median economist estimate of 104,000 and unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% from 4.1% as expected,investors boosted the odds of a September rate cut to almost 90%, from around 40% the day before, according to interest-rate futures contracts.

**Trade Policy & Fiscal:**

Average U.S. tariff rate has surged to ~20.6%. Sweeping tariffs took effect on August 1 for countries that lacked deals by Trump's deadline: duties range from 10% to 55% on imports (55% on many Chinese goods, 25% on most autos, 50% on steel/aluminum, and a baseline 10% on others). However, last-minute trade agreements have partially defused worst-case scenarios: for example, the EU, Japan, South Korea, and UK secured deals to cap U.S. tariffs at 15% instead of 25‚Äì30%. China, the primary target, reached a preliminary deal in June but still faces 55% tariffs on many exports ‚Äì and an August 12 deadline looms to finalize a ‚Äúdurable‚Äù tariff agreement with Washington. On the fiscal front, the U.S. is contending with higher defense and subsidy spending (e.g. farm aid in response to tariffs), and there‚Äôs talk of tax cuts, but so far the dollar‚Äôs reserve status has kept financing costs manageable.

GENIUS Act:

On July 18, 2025, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act) into law, marking the first federal legislation in the United States to regulate stablecoins. Stablecoin issuers are required to maintain a 1:1 reserve ratio, backing each issued stablecoin with liquid assets such as U.S. dollars, short-term Treasury bills, or other low-risk government-approved assets. The implications for the US Treasury are twofold:

1) Increased Demand for Treasuries: By requiring stablecoin issuers to back their assets with U.S. Treasuries, the law is anticipated to drive up demand for these securities, potentially affecting their yields and liquidity.

2) Enhanced Dollar Supremacy: The integration of stablecoins into the financial system could reinforce the U.S. dollar's dominance in global trade and finance, as stablecoins provide a digital, efficient means of transacting in dollars.

**Economic Growth:**

The U.S. economy is expanding but showing mixed signals. Q2 GDP growth surprised to the upside (the economy rebounded after a slight Q1 dip), but much of the strength came from an import plunge (imports subtract from GDP, so tariffs artificially boosted the math) while domestic demand grew at its slowest pace in ~2.5 years. Consumers are still spending, supported by a strong labor market and earlier excess savings, but business investment has been cautious amid trade uncertainty. Manufacturing is soft ‚Äì the ISM factory index is teetering around contraction levels ‚Äì as companies grapple with supply-chain disruptions and higher input costs due to tariffs. Conversely, sectors like services and technology remain robust. The housing market has shown signs of revival thanks to stable mortgage rates, and energy investment is picking up with oil prices off their lows. Overall, the consensus expects moderate growth (~2% for 2025) but with downside risks. Notably, the Fed‚Äôs stance is that if tariffs start crimping consumer spending and growth, they might have to ‚Äúrise to the rescue‚Äù despite the inflation uptick. Investors are thus balancing decent current data (e.g. jobless claims remain low, consumer confidence is high) against the clear headwinds of trade policy and fading fiscal stimulus.


**Eurozone:**

Inflation & ECB: Eurozone inflation has fallen back to 2%, hitting the ECB's target. Headline CPI held at 2.0% y/y in June (up slightly from 1.9% in May), while core inflation is ~2.3%. The European Central Bank has pivoted to easing mode: over the past year, the ECB cut rates by 200 bps (the deposit rate is now 2.0%, down from a peak of 4.0%). At its July 24 meeting, the ECB left rates unchanged and maintained a dovish bias, as policymakers debate if further stimulus is needed to prevent inflation from undershooting target given very weak growth. Market pricing anticipates one more 25 bps ECB rate cut to ~1.75% by year-end, then a pause. Notably, the ECB‚Äôs easing path is constrained by concern that inflation could settle below 2% (with recession risks looming), even as some hawks worry about upside risks (like wage growth in services).


Growth & Outlook: Eurozone economy is flirting with stagnation, GDP growth is tracking under 1% for 2025. Manufacturing remains weak due to softer global demand and energy price shocks. Consumer spending is lacklustre as real income gains are minimal and retail sales volumes are flat to down in many countries. Business investment is subdued given uncertainty around trade and energy policy. On the positive side, unemployment in Europe is at record lows and there are signs that wage growth and fiscal support are cushioning domestic demands. The composite PMI for July slipped below 50, indicating contraction, led by shrinking manufacturing and a cooling in services. The strong euro earlier this year (it had risen about 10% vs USD year-to-date) compounded the challenge for exporters. Full-year 2025 growth is now expected around 0.6‚Äì0.8% (the IMF even projects <1% through 2026) ‚Äì effectively a stagnation scenario. The key question: will ECB stimulus and easing trade fears lead to a late-year pickup, or is Europe drifting toward recession?

Trade War Impact: Trade showdown between Trump and EU Commision President led to a deal to slash the threatened tariffs to 15% from 30% which plunged the Euro. In exchange, the EU offered greater market access for U.S. goods (and as hinted, perhaps increased defense and energy purchases). Overall, the Eurozone enters late 2025 with policy support in overdrive but facing huge external challenges ‚Äì its fortunes may depend on stabilization in the U.S.-China and U.S.-EU trade rifts and a revival of global demand.


**China:**

**Economic Performance:** 

China's economy is growing moderately, aided by government stimulus as it navigates the trade war. In Q2 2025, GDP grew +5.25% year on year. This solid growth was driven by strong exports to the rest of the world, possibly due to front loading. Domestic activity is mixed, industrial output rose a robust +6.8% y/y in June. Retail sales climed ~4.8% in June. The major soft spot is investment, especially in real estate: fixed asset investment in H1 was up only +2.8%, as property investment collapsed (‚Äì11.2% y/y) amid the ongoing real estate downturn. Several large property developers remain in distress, and new construction is limited. This property slump has been a drag on steel, cement, and related sectors. Overall, China‚Äôs growth appears to be on a glide path around the mid-5% range ‚Äì slower than the pre-pandemic era, but not the ‚Äúhard landing‚Äù some feared. The IMF in fact upgraded China‚Äôs 2025 growth forecast to 4.8% (from 4.0% prior) due to stronger-than-expected early-year activity and some tariff reductions that eased pressures. Still, there are ‚Äúcracks‚Äù showing ‚Äì youth unemployment hit record highs (>20%), deflationary trends are emerging in some sectors, and export orders remain soft.

**Policy Measures:**  

Chinese authorities are leaning on both fiscal and monetary stimulus to prop up growth. The People‚Äôs Bank of China has maintained a ‚Äúmoderately loose‚Äù monetary policy, cutting key interest rates and pumping liquidity into the banking system. However, there‚Äôs debate about its effectiveness: with businesses and consumers cautious (due to uncertain outlook and past debt burdens), cheaper credit has not translated into a big jump in new loans ‚Äì many firms are hoarding cash or deleveraging rather than investing. As a result, the government has also turned to fiscal tools: tax breaks for small businesses, infrastructure spending boosts, and consumer subsidies (such as cash incentives to trade in old appliances and cars for new ones, which has clearly lifted those sales). In the property sector, some cities eased home purchase restrictions and banks cut mortgage rates to stabilize housing demand. Thus far, these measures have put a floor under growth but not sparked a sharp rebound. The central government has signaled more support to come ‚Äì potentially a broader stimulus package focused on domestic consumption and new-energy industries. Importantly, inflation in China is around 0% (in fact, China may be flirting with deflation), which gives policymakers room to ease without fear of price overheating. The PBOC‚Äôs deputy governor noted that current easing measures‚Äô impact is ‚Äústill unfolding‚Äù and more may be deployed. One structural policy priority is boosting household income and reducing precautionary saving ‚Äì Beijing is gradually expanding the social safety net to encourage consumers to spend more and save less. But such reforms are slow-moving. In summary, China is using a targeted stimulus approach ‚Äì avoiding the massive credit binge of past cycles, and instead trying to sustain growth just above 5% while addressing financial risks.


**Trade & Geopolitics:**

The U.S.‚ÄìChina trade war continues to cast a long shadow. Since January, the U.S. has imposed a 55% tariff on most Chinese exports to America, drastically raising costs for Chinese firms. This has hurt sectors like electronics and appliances ‚Äì for instance, U.S.-bound shipments of those goods have dropped sharply (some production is relocating to Southeast Asia to bypass tariffs). To mitigate the damage, China has been diversifying its trade: exports to ASEAN, Africa, and the Middle East have grown, and China has been actively courting European and Global South markets to pick up the slack. Interestingly, China itself has benefited in some cases from trade diversion ‚Äì e.g. U.S. tariffs on European steel/aluminum led to China selling more metals in other markets. On the negotiation front, Beijing and Washington reached ‚Äúpreliminary‚Äù trade deals in May and June, involving China pledging to buy more U.S. agriculture and energy. This was similar to the 2020 Phase 1 deal playbook. In return, the U.S. postponed some tariff escalations. However, a comprehensive deal is still under discussion. High-level U.S.-China talks resumed in Stockholm this week ‚Äì the urgency is high, as an August 12 deadline nears for potentially even tougher U.S. measures if talks falter. The IMF assumes in its baseline that many tariff hikes won‚Äôt happen (i.e. ‚Äúpauses on higher tariffs are assumed to remain in place‚Äù), but this is a precarious equilibrium. Apart from tariffs, China faces U.S. export controls on technology (chips, etc.), which Beijing has retaliated against by restricting exports of certain critical minerals. Geopolitically, tensions remain elevated (Taiwan, South China Sea), but both sides have shown interest in stabilizing economic ties. From China‚Äôs perspective, one positive is the trade war has reinforced efforts to be more self-reliant in tech and to deepen partnerships with other countries (e.g. the UK and China quietly inked a deal reducing some tariffs as part of Trump‚Äôs reciprocal tariff strategy). Bottom line: China‚Äôs economy is managing to grow steadily through the turbulence, thanks to stimulus and adaptability, but the external environment ‚Äì tariffs, weak global demand ‚Äì is a significant headwind that is keeping growth below pre-trade-war trajectories.
