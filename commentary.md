📅 Date: 15 Sep - 19 Sep 2025	

🌎 Macro Environment Summary: 

US

Policy & markets. The Fed cut 25 bp on Sep 17 to 4.00–4.25%, its first cut of 2025, and signaled the possibility of two more cuts this year. Powell said there wasn’t broad support for a larger (50 bp) move, framing the step as risk-management amid a softer labor market. Front-end yields fell and risk assets rallied into the week’s close. 

Growth & prices. The policy pivot followed months of cooling labor indicators; markets now watch the next inflation print to judge how quickly the easing path evolves. 10Y ~4.14% and 2Y ~3.57% on Sep 19 captured a bull-steepening bias post-FOMC. 

Takeaway. Guidance turned easing-biased but data-dependent; the main asymmetry is a hawkish repricing if near-term inflation surprises on the upside. 


Eurozone

Inflation & policy. The ECB held in Sep with staff projections keeping headline near 2% through 2025 and core easing in 2026–27; tone was “pause and assess.” 

Activity. Earlier HICP (Aug) ~2.1% y/y and modest PMI improvement leave the ECB patient, with curves still taking directional cues from the U.S. 

China

Data. Aug activity missed: industrial output +5.2% y/y, retail sales +3.4% y/y; new-home prices fell again—reinforcing weak domestic demand. 

Policy & FX. Markets expected LPRs to stay at 3.00% / 3.50% (Sep 20 fixing) despite the Fed cut, underscoring Beijing’s preference for targeted easing and CNY stability. 

Other

Japan. The BoJ held at 0.50% (7–2 vote) but surprised by starting ETF/J-REIT sales, while two members backed a hike to 0.75%. That kept normalization risk alive; JPY firmed and equities wobbled. 
Bank of Japan

EM flows. The IIF reported $44.8bn EM portfolio inflows in Aug (with July revised to $38.1bn), but highlighted growing fragility and dispersion beneath the headline. 


📊 Market Drivers (15–19 Sep)

Rates. The Fed’s move produced a bull-steepener: 10Y ~4.14%, 2Y ~3.57% by Friday, with long-end stickiness reflecting term-premium and supply themes even as the front-end prices more easing. 

FX. The USD whipsawed—softer into FOMC, then steadier after Powell’s cautious press conference: DXY ~97.6 (Sep 19); EURUSD ~1.175 after backing off ~1.19 highs; USDJPY ~148 as BoJ headlines supported JPY. 

Commodities.
• Oil: Despite the Fed cut, Brent ~$66–68 as oversupply and weak distillate demand capped rallies; EIA showed a 9.3mb crude draw but a +4mb distillate build. OPEC+’s earlier +547 kb/d Sep hike still framed supply. 

• Gold: Extended its run—spot ~$3,650–3,660/oz—on lower real-rate expectations and ongoing policy uncertainty. 

• Copper: The COMEX–LME tariff premium continued to unwind after the U.S. clarified that semis are targeted while refined metal is excluded; positioning and inventories remained distorted. 

Equities.
• US: Another record-setting week; S&P +1.2%, Nasdaq +2.2%, Dow +1.05% as the cut supported multiples even with mixed housing data. 

• Europe/Asia: Europe rose on calmer rates; Japan dipped as BoJ’s ETF/J-REIT plan and hawkish split lifted yields and firmed JPY. 


📌 Positioning / Sentiment

• Fed path: Markets price more cuts in 2025; Powell pushed back on 50 bp step-downs, keeping outcomes “meeting-by-meeting.” 

• Dollar: Post-FOMC, USD steadied from early-week softness; EUR and AUD gains faded late-week. 

• Rates bias: Steepener remains consensus—front-end led by policy, long-end anchored by term premium/supply. 

• EM risk: Headline inflows persist, but dispersion (China vs ex-China) is rising. 


🧠 Personal Takeaways

Powell cut, cautiously. The Fed validated a dovish skew but resisted a larger cut; that supports front-end duration while leaving hawkish-surprise risk if inflation pops. 


Steepener bias intact. The front-end should absorb most of the easing; the 10Y stays sticky on supply/term-premium and fiscal optics. 


Eurozone: patient. With inflation ~2% and growth fragile, the ECB can stay sidelined; EUR trades the Fed path and energy dynamics. 


China: incrementalism. Soft Aug data and LPR steady-bias argue for targeted easing and FX stability rather than bazooka stimulus. 


Japan: normalization risk. Hold + ETF/J-REIT sales + split board keep JPY bid on dips and JGB term premia biased higher.
