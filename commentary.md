📅 Date: 22 Sep - 26 Sep 2025	

🌎 Macro Environment (22–26 Sep)
US

Policy & markets. After the Sep 17 cut, the Fed’s meeting-by-meeting stance remained intact, and attention shifted to August PCE on Friday. The data came in as expected—headline PCE 2.7% y/y (+0.3% m/m) and core 2.9% y/y (+0.2% m/m)—reducing fears of a hawkish pushback. Equities bounced into the close, while rates and USD moves were orderly. 

Growth & prices. The BEA reported solid August spending +0.6% m/m (real PCE +0.4%) with income +0.4%—evidence that consumption momentum carried into Q3 even as inflation ticked modestly higher. Markets read the mix as growth OK / inflation contained, consistent with the Fed easing bias but still data-dependent. 

Takeaway. The cut is validated, not accelerated: inflation isn’t re-accelerating, but nor is it falling fast enough to green-light 50 bps steps. Near-term asymmetry remains hawkish if the next prints surprise hot. 

Eurozone

Inflation & policy. With HICP running near target and the ECB in a pause-and-assess stance, euro rates largely took direction from the U.S. into Friday’s PCE. 

Activity. Flash PMIs (Sep) improved again: the HCOB composite 51.2 marked a 9-month run of expansion, though momentum is still modest and uneven across member states. 


China

Data. A late-week surprise: industrial profits jumped 20.4% y/y in August, lifting Jan–Aug to +0.9% after year-to-date declines—helped by policy efforts to curb “excessive competition” and some stabilization in factory prices. Housing remains a drag (new-home prices still falling), so the broader demand picture is fragile. 

Policy & FX. Authorities continued to signal a preference for CNY stability; with the Fed easing and local data mixed, markets expect targeted measures rather than a broad-based stimulus push. 

Japan

BoJ tone. Post-meeting chatter stayed hawkish at the margin: July minutes showed some policymakers arguing for future hikes, and a former BoJ board member said policy rates could ultimately reach ~1.5% under Ueda—keeping normalization risk live. 

📊 Market Drivers (22–26 Sep)

Rates. After the PCE print, the U.S. curve leaned to a bull-steepening bias—front-end anchored by cut odds, long end still sticky on term-premium/supply optics. Into Friday, the 10Y hovered ~4.1% while the 2Y traded mid-3.5s. 

FX. The USD faded early in the week on cut expectations but firmed into Thursday, then stabilized after PCE (DXY ~98.5 Thu, easing Friday). EURUSD pulled back from ~1.19 highs toward the high-1.17s, while USDJPY ~147–148 as BoJ-normalization risk limited JPY downside even with U.S. cuts priced. 

Commodities.
• Oil: A tightening narrative returned mid-week on a surprise U.S. crude draw and Russia’s fuel-export curbs—Brent ~$69–70 by Friday, its strongest week in months. 


• Gold: Fresh record highs above $3,740/oz earlier in the week on cut bets and geopolitical hedging; held elevated into PCE. 

• Copper: The COMEX tariff premium continued to unwind after earlier clarification that refined metal was excluded from U.S. tariffs; positioning remains lighter after funds de-risked in early September. 


Equities.
• US: Despite a Friday pop on in-line PCE, major indices were set for their worst week since late July, reflecting valuation digestion and tariff uncertainty; cyclicals and energy outperformed on the day. 


• Europe/Asia: Europe tracked calmer rates and firmer PMIs; Japan was choppy as yen firmness and BoJ normalization chatter weighed on exporters. 


📌 Positioning / Sentiment

• Fed path: Markets keep more 2025 cuts in play but accept a gradual pace; Powell’s restraint on 50 bps still resonates. 


• Dollar: After a multi-month drop, the USD found tactical support mid-week on better U.S. data before fading with the in-line PCE. 


• Rates bias: Steepener consensus persists—front-end led by policy, long end anchored by supply/term-premium dynamics. 


• Commodities risk: Energy bid on supply headlines; gold enjoys a policy/geopolitical premium with several banks raising long-dated targets. 


🧠 Personal Takeaways

US: The Fed has air cover to keep cutting, but PCE at 2.7%/2.9% (core) argues against rushing; front-end duration works, and steepeners remain attractive with long-end term-premium sticky. 


Eurozone: A “patient ECB” plus improved PMIs supports EUR-on-dips, but the move is still Fed-path-dependent. 


China: The industrial-profit rebound is welcome, yet property drag and soft demand cap the impulse; yuan stability + incremental easing stays the base case. 


Japan: Hike-leaning signals keep JPY dips bought and JGB term premia biased higher; FX is tightly linked to the U.S. long end.
