üìÖ Date: 18 Aug - 24 Aug 2025	

üåé Macro Environment Summary: 

**US:**

Policy & markets: At Jackson Hole, Chair Powell signalled the Fed is open to a September cut, citing a shift in the balance of risks toward the labour market while acknowledging lingering inflation uncertainty. Futures quickly priced ~85‚Äì90% odds of a 25 bp cut; Treasury yields fell, equities rallied, and the USD slipped into the Friday close. 

Growth pulse & prices: S&P Global flash PMIs (Aug) show the private sector still expanding; the composite rose to 55.4, with manufacturing back in expansion and input/output price gauges firming‚Äîcompanies specifically cited tariffs in higher costs. Jobless claims ticked up mid-week, reinforcing the ‚Äúgrowth cooling / policy easing‚Äù narrative. 

Takeaway: Policy guidance turned easing-biased but data-dependent. Markets are primed for a Sept cut, leaving asymmetry if the next inflation/employment prints surprise hot. 


**Eurozone:**

Inflation & policy: HICP held at 2.0% y/y (Jul) with core ~2.3%, reinforcing expectations that the ECB stays on hold after its rapid easing earlier this year. Sources guidance suggested a September pause, with scope to revisit cuts later if growth/inflation soften again. 
European Commission

Activity: Q2 GDP +0.1% q/q and improving Aug flash PMIs suggest a modest broadening in activity (manufacturing out of contraction for the first time since 2022 in some surveys), but momentum remains fragile.

Trade tensions: The US-EU tariff cap (~15%) limited worst-case damage vs earlier threats, but policymakers still flag uncertainty around export demand and price dynamics. 


**China:**

Data: July prints missed forecasts‚Äîindustrial output +5.7% y/y, retail sales +3.7% y/y, FAI slowed‚Äîunderscoring soft domestic demand. CPI 0.0% y/y and PPI ‚àí3.6% y/y keep deflation concerns alive. New-home prices ‚àí0.3% m/m and ‚àí2.8% y/y highlight property drag. 
Reuters

Policy & FX: The PBOC left LPRs unchanged (1-yr 3.00% / 5-yr 3.50%, Aug 20), prioritising targeted support over broad easing. Bearish CNY positioning rebuilt toward May highs as growth data disappointed; authorities continue to signal a preference for yuan stability. 

Takeaway: Incremental easing and administrative support continue; without stronger consumption/property stabilisation, growth looks sub-trend into H2. 


**Other:**

Japan: Q2 GDP beat and sticky core CPI keep BOJ normalisation risk on the table later this year.

EM flows: IIF estimated $55.5bn EM portfolio inflows in July (2nd-largest in four years), supporting risk appetite and carry into August‚Äîconditional on US data and China sentiment

**üìä Market Drivers:**

**Rates:**
US: Powell‚Äôs tone delivered a bull-steepening impulse: front-end anchored by cut odds while 10y hovered near the mid-4.2s late week as term-premium/supply themes linger. Next catalysts are the final pre-FOMC labour and inflation prints. 

Eurozone: At-target inflation and better PMIs argue for patience; curves largely took direction from the US. 

Japan: Solid growth + above-target core CPI keep JGB term premia biased higher on any BOJ guidance shift.
  
**Commodities:**

Oil: OPEC+ confirmed another +547 kb/d addition for September, continuing its market-share push. Prices stabilised late-week on a larger-than-expected US crude draw and geopolitics; Brent sat in the mid-$60s area. 

Gold: Traded a $3,33x‚Äì3,42x/oz range‚Äîsoftened as the USD firmed mid-week, then recovered as cut odds rose post-Powell. Asian physical demand remained patchy given volatility. 

Copper: The US 50% tariff clarification‚Äîsemis targeted; ore/refined excluded‚Äîsaw the earlier COMEX premium unwind. Fundamentals remain a tug-of-war: tight ore vs subdued China demand.

  
**FX:**

USD: Two-way through the week‚Äîfirmer into Powell, then slipped on the dovish read; DXY eased ~0.4% Friday. EURUSD drifted toward the mid-1.16s; USDJPY eased to ~147‚Äì148. 

EUR: Supported by at-target HICP and improving PMIs; still sensitive to Fed path. 

JPY: Bid on growth/CPI mix and BOJ normalisation risk; remains correlated with US yields.

EM FX: July‚Äôs inflows support carry, but Asia ex-JP is CNY-beta‚Äîweak China prints kept a lid on rallies. 


**Equities:**

US: Powell-rally into Friday (S&P and Russell outperformed; cyclicals picked up) after a choppy start to the week. PMI strength helped breadth, though tariff-linked price indices stayed hot. 
Reuters

Europe: Gains on earnings + improving PMIs; defensives and banks outperformed as rate volatility cooled.

Asia: Japan supported by GDP; China A-shares choppy on soft data and unchanged LPRs.

**üìå Positioning / Sentiment:**

EM risk appetite: $55.5bn July inflows underline constructive sentiment; helps local debt/FX unless US data re-accelerates. 

Dollar positioning: Momentum shorts re-engaged post-Powell; positioning remains tactically light vs early-August. (FX price action and futures pricing corroborate.) 


China: CNY shorts rebuilt to near May highs (poll-based), consistent with disappointing July data and unchanged LPRs.

Rates: US duration longs added on the speech; the steepener is increasingly consensus into supply/term-premium dynamics.

**üß† Personal Takeaways:**

Powell can cut‚Äîdata permitting. The Fed validated a dovish skew without pre-committing. That keeps front-end duration and quality risk supported, but embeds disappointment risk if inflation surprises or claims roll lower. 

Steepener bias intact. Markets anchor the 2y to policy easing while the 10y digests supply/term premia and tariff risk. Auction strength/term-premium gauges are the next tells. 

Eurozone: cautiously better. At-target HICP and firmer PMIs justify ECB patience and EUR-on-dips, but external demand and trade policy are swing factors. 

China: incrementalism, not bazooka. Weak July data + unchanged LPRs + rebuilding CNY shorts argue for patience on China-beta until property support scales and demand stabilises. 


Commodities: push-pull regime. OPEC+ supply additions vs US draws/geopolitics keep oil in a range; gold still works as a policy/geopolitical hedge if real yields drift lower into easing.
