**Trade 1: USDJPY Short** 

Time horizon: 4–8 weeks
Conviction: Medium (build on strength)
Theme: Narrowing US–JP rate differential + sticky JP inflation/wages + rising BoJ hike risk

US side: The Fed held rates at 4.25–4.50% in July and is openly data-dependent. July CPI ran +0.2% m/m; 2.7% y/y (core 3.1%) and July payrolls were +73k with clear cooling momentum—conditions that increase the odds of a September cut, pressuring the front end and the USD. 

Japan side: The BoJ kept its policy rate at 0.50% but raised its inflation outlook; Tokyo July core CPI printed ~2.9% y/y and wages from 2025 shuntō settled ~5.25%, supporting a “wages→prices” loop BoJ wants before further normalization. Markets are leaning to at least one hike into year-end. Japan’s economy expanded faster than expected last quarter led by solid domestic demand, boosting the case for the Bank of Japan to raise its benchmark rate again this year. Gains were led by business investment, which rose 1.3% from the previous quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.7% growth, and private consumption nudged 0.2% higher. Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 1% in the three months through June from the prior period, surpassing economists’ forecast of a 0.4% gain

Net effect: With the Fed likely to ease first and the BoJ keeping hike risk alive, the rate spread should compress, historically bearish USD/JPY.

**Trade plan**

Entry: 148.75 (Sell Limit Triggered 22/8/2025)

Stop: 150 (above the early-Aug rebound highs; invalidates near-term lower-highs set-up).

Targets: T1 145.00, T2 142.00 (stretch if Fed signals a larger cut path).

Positioning: Start ½ size at 147.8–148.2, complete at 148.3–148.5; risk per trade ≤ 0.75% of NAV.

Catalysts (next 2–4 weeks)

US: Aug NFP (Sep 5) and Aug CPI (Sep 11)—further cooling/lower core would pull 2y yields down and USD with it; FOMC (Sep meeting) for first cut timing. 

Japan: Tokyo Aug CPI (Aug 28) for a lead on national CPI; BoJ meeting Sep 18–19—any tightening cues/high-NA wage references lift JPY.

What could go wrong (and what to do)

US inflation re-accelerates (core >3.2% y/y) → Fed pushback; cut risk falls.

Mitigate: Keep tight stop; if core beats, reduce to residual or flip to neutral until the FOMC. 

BoJ turns dovish (downplays wage pass-through / trims CPI path).

Mitigate: Exit on close >149.7 or if BoJ signals no hikes for ’25 in the Outlook text. 

Risk-on surge (equities rip, USD bid broadly).

Mitigate: Hedge with a small long USD/JPY call (OTM 1-month) against tail moves.
