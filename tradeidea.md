**Trade 1: USDJPY Short** 

Time horizon: 4–8 weeks
Conviction: Medium (build on strength)
Theme: Narrowing US–JP rate differential + sticky JP inflation/wages + rising BoJ hike risk

US side: The Fed held rates at 4.25–4.50% in July and is openly data-dependent. July CPI ran +0.2% m/m; 2.7% y/y (core 3.1%) and July payrolls were +73k with clear cooling momentum—conditions that increase the odds of a September cut, pressuring the front end and the USD. 

Japan side: The BoJ kept its policy rate at 0.50% but raised its inflation outlook; Tokyo July core CPI printed ~2.9% y/y and wages from 2025 shuntō settled ~5.25%, supporting a “wages→prices” loop BoJ wants before further normalization. Markets are leaning to at least one hike into year-end. Japan’s economy expanded faster than expected last quarter led by solid domestic demand, boosting the case for the Bank of Japan to raise its benchmark rate again this year. Gains were led by business investment, which rose 1.3% from the previous quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.7% growth, and private consumption nudged 0.2% higher. Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 1% in the three months through June from the prior period, surpassing economists’ forecast of a 0.4% gain

Net effect: With the Fed likely to ease first and the BoJ keeping hike risk alive, the rate spread should compress, historically bearish USD/JPY.

**Trade plan**

Entry: 148.75 (Sell Limit Triggered 22/8/2025)

Stop: 150 (above the early-Aug rebound highs; invalidates near-term lower-highs set-up).

Targets: T1 145.00, T2 142.00 (stretch if Fed signals a larger cut path).

Positioning: Start ½ size at 147.8–148.2, complete at 148.3–148.5; risk per trade ≤ 0.75% of NAV.

Catalysts (next 2–4 weeks)

US: Aug NFP (Sep 5) and Aug CPI (Sep 11)—further cooling/lower core would pull 2y yields down and USD with it; FOMC (Sep meeting) for first cut timing. 

Japan: Tokyo Aug CPI (Aug 28) for a lead on national CPI; BoJ meeting Sep 18–19—any tightening cues/high-NA wage references lift JPY.

What could go wrong (and what to do)

US inflation re-accelerates (core >3.2% y/y) → Fed pushback; cut risk falls.

Mitigate: Keep tight stop; if core beats, reduce to residual or flip to neutral until the FOMC. 

BoJ turns dovish (downplays wage pass-through / trims CPI path).

Mitigate: Exit on close >149.7 or if BoJ signals no hikes for ’25 in the Outlook text. 

Risk-on surge (equities rip, USD bid broadly).

Mitigate: Hedge with a small long USD/JPY call (OTM 1-month) against tail moves.




**Trade 2: EURUSD Short** 

Time Horizone: 3months
Conviction: Medium
Theme: Sticky services inflation in EU and weakening labour market and softening inflation in US 

US: Fed cut rates by 25 bps to 4.00-4.25% in September Fed meeting on weak labour market reflected in the previous 2 NFP data. Inflation has been cooling as well. Core PCE is 2.9% y-o-y while headline PCE is 2.7% which gives the Fed more room to cut. Labour market is losing
its momentum with a weak print of +22k jobs in the August NFP data and unemployment up to 4.3%. 

EU: ECB on hold with deposit rates at 2%, Euro area HICP is at 2% y-o-y. Eurozone momentum is stabilising with flash PMI at 16 month high even if still soft, recession risk is receding at the margin. Euro area runs a sizeable current account surplus as well which is a medium term EUR support. 
Q2 GDP grew 0.1% q-o-q and composite PMI ticked above 50 which helps cap downside fears. Labour market on the other hand is still firm at 6.2% near record lows. 

Still high inflation in food and services has led to increase in inflation forecast and strong labour market will keep real wage growth above productivity, keeping inflationary pressure.
Headline inflation stood at 2% in August, service and food prices remain above target, increasing by more than 3% y-o-y. Service accounts for most of the price basket in HICP and wages are main driver with wages increase more than 4% y-o-y.

Strong labour market helps economy withstand shocks as unemployment at multi decade low of 6.2%. This is due to labour market reforms, AI boom playing a significant role in job creation which will cause GDP growth to increase and unemployment to fall.


Trade Plan:

Seagull: Buy 3m 1.19 call, Sell 3m 1.21 put, Sell 3m 1.15 put 
Size the short put at 25–50% of the call-spread notional (e.g., 1/2 or 1/3 size) to keep the left tail contained.
Clear topside target (1.19–1.21), cheap carry and smaller left-tail, and don’t need unlimited upside. I’ll use a risk-reversal if I think EUR can overshoot and I’m happy to wear more tail and vega.

Risks: higher tariffs, adverse geopolitical developments, spillover effects from slower economic growth for trading partners.
